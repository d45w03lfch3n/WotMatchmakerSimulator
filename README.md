# WotMatchmakerSimulator
A World of Tanks matchmaker simulator framework

This is a little framework written in Java which shall enable people to write and to test their own matchmaker algorithms for World of Tanks.
The goal is either to figure out that there is a great matchmaker algorithm that WG should adapt - or to find out that writing a great matchmaking algorithm is fudging hard.

World of Tanks is a trademark of Wargaming.net
